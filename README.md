本人曾担任一线互联网大厂算法工程师，team leader，某算法讲堂金牌客串讲师，被同学们封为算法教父，山景城扫地僧。目前坐标西雅图，所带关门弟子大多已经上岸。归隐三年，现在重回市场，摘下一切标签，只为提供行业内最高标准的服务，帮助更多同学上岸！  
I have served as an algorithm engineer and team leader at a top-tier internet company, a guest lecturer at a renowned algorithm academy, and was dubbed the "Algorithm Godfather" and the "Hidden Master of Mountain View" by students. Currently based in Seattle, most of my close disciples have successfully secured their desired positions. After three years of seclusion, I am now returning to the market, shedding all labels, solely to provide the highest industry standards of service and help more students achieve their goals!
